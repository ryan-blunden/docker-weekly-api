# The data directory

## WARNING Beware the `bin/get_issue.py` script

Running the `bin/get_issue.py` script may result in replacing complete data with incomplete data!

As not all Docker Weekly issues were able to be automatically parsed, manual work copy-and-paste work was done to finish the population of the `data/issues` files.

It would've been really nice to have had the parsing fully automated as then, the parsing could've been improved over time and additional content parsing such as tags could've been implemented. Maybe this will be in the future.
